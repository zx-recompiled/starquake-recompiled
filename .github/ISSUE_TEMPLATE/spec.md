<!-- The workflow (CLAUDE.md, "How work lands"): fill the SPEC, settle its
     decisions with the maintainer here, then fill the PLAN. The maintainer's
     OK on the plan (dragging the card to Build, or a `go` comment) is the
     go-ahead to build. The implementation PR says `Closes #NN`.

     THIS BODY IS THE LIVING SPEC. THE COMMENTS ARE THE HISTORY.
       - BODY: always current. When a question is answered, MOVE it into
         Decisions and DELETE it from Open questions. The body must never keep
         asking something that has been settled.
       - COMMENTS: append-only. A new `> 🤖 **Next steps**` comment each time
         the state changes; never edit an old one. Answers given in chat are
         written back into this BODY.

     Filed by Claude? The body's first line is the attribution header:

     `gh issue create --body-file` bypasses this template, so read it and fill
     its sections by hand. -->

## Spec

### Goal

<!-- One paragraph: what ships, and the one-line reason it exists. -->

### Decisions

<!-- Numbered, settled with the maintainer, each with its why. -->

### Open questions

<!-- Anything still FOR the maintainer, with the options and a
     recommendation on every line. End with a block they copy, fill in and
     paste back as a comment:

     ```
     # keep your pick, delete the rest
     Q1 <topic>: option a (rec) / option b / option c
     Q2 <topic>: option a / option b (rec)
     notes =
     ```

     No view on one? Say so on its line: `discuss (rec)`. Mirror the block in
     the Next-steps comment. Delete this section once everything is settled. -->

### Design

<!-- The game, the verifier, the interpreter or CI, at whatever depth the
     change needs. Name real symbols (files, types, functions), since the plan
     builds on them. -->

### Mockup (visual work only)

<!-- Anything whose value is how it LOOKS gets a mockup approved here before
     the real UI is built (the `mockup` skill). Anything the Spectrum itself
     draws is mocked up as a real 256x192 screenshot, not an HTML sketch.
     Embed it with this form:
     ![mockup](https://github.com/zx-recompiled/starquake-recompiled/raw/<branch>/docs/mockups/<file>.png)
     The PR that merges it repoints the embed to /raw/main/. -->

### Fidelity

<!-- Can this move any of the 25 differential suites, or the Z80
     conformance tests (z80test and the Fuse corpus)? If so, say why that
     is right BEFORE the work starts: a suite is never adjusted to make a
     change pass. Does the work need the game or the ROM in assets/, which
     CI has not got? -->

### Out of scope

<!-- Deferred pieces, each with the issue that tracks it. -->

## Plan

<!-- Tasks in landing order; each ends green (`.claude/scripts/check.sh`) and
     is one commit on the implementation PR. Failing tests first where
     practical. Ticked as they land: the ticks and the branch are the progress
     record. -->

- [ ] Task 1 —
- [ ] Task 2 —
- [ ] Docs: `README.md` / `CLAUDE.md` updated in the same PR if anything they say changed
