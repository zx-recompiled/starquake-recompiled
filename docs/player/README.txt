STARQUAKE
=========

A reimplementation of Starquake (Stephen Crow, Bubble Bus Software,
1985) for modern computers. It is not an emulator: the game is
rewritten as ordinary Rust.


YOU NEED THE ORIGINAL GAME
--------------------------

This program contains no code or data from the original game. It reads
every graphic, map, piece of text and sound from your own copy of
Starquake, a .tap tape, when it starts, and it will not run without one.

World of Spectrum keeps Spectrum software available and removes titles
whose rights holders object. It lists Starquake as available. A dump of
a tape you own works just as well.

RUNNING IT
----------

Run starquake, or starquake.exe on Windows. If it cannot find your
tape it asks for it: pick the file, or drop it onto the window. The zip
World of Spectrum serves (Starquake.tap.zip) works as it is, with no
need to unpack it. The tape is then kept for next time in the usual
place for application data:

  Linux     ~/.local/share/starquake-recompiled/
  macOS     ~/Library/Application Support/starquake-recompiled/
  Windows   %APPDATA%\starquake-recompiled\

It also finds the tape, or the zip, if you put it in the same folder as
the program, named starquake.tap or STARQUAK.TAP in any case. You can
name it on the command line as well.

macOS: the program is not signed, so macOS blocks it the first time.
In Terminal, in this folder, run:

  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine starquake

Or try to open it once, then allow it under System Settings, Privacy &
Security.


CONTROLS
--------

  Arrow keys           Move, with the Kempston or cursor key control
                       methods. They press 5 6 7 8, the Spectrum's own
                       cursor keys.
  Up                   Pick up or swap items. With the hover platform,
                       rise.
  Down                 Build a platform.
  Alt, full stop or    Fire.
  comma
  Gamepad              D-pad or left stick to move. Up boards the
                       hover platform and flies it up, down flies it
                       down; neither picks up or builds.
                       The bottom face button only builds a platform,
                       the right one only picks up or swaps an item,
                       and the left one fires. A and B are wherever
                       the pad's maker puts them: on an Xbox pad the
                       platform is A and the item B, on a Switch pad
                       the other way round, on a PlayStation pad the
                       cross and the circle. Start pauses, Select
                       opens guidance (below). Works in
                       every control method, over USB or Bluetooth.
                       Some controllers need the right mode: an 8BitDo
                       in Switch mode is detected but sends no input,
                       so try one of its other modes.
  P                    Pause.
  A S D F G together   Abandon the game.
  Esc                  Guidance (below).
  F11                  Leave fullscreen for a window, or go back.
                       On a Mac: Control-Command-F.

The game starts fullscreen. The picture is always scaled by a whole
number, so fullscreen is often a step larger than any window fits.

At the title screen, 1 to 5 choose how to play, 6 defines your own
keys, 0 starts the game and Q quits. Any key stops the tune. On a
gamepad, Start or the fire button starts the game.

A teleport's booth asks for a code on the keyboard. On a gamepad,
press any button there and five slots appear: up and down choose a
letter, left and right move between the slots, A enters the code and
B clears it. From guidance level 1, X fills in each code you have
seen in turn, and the panel's list marks the one in the slots.

The high-score table, the CORE OF HEROES, is kept between runs in
high-scores.txt, in the folder the tape is kept in. Beside it the panel
shows how much guidance each entry's game had. A game played with
training mode on is shown in the table and then left out of it.

Every teleport code you discover is kept too, the ones your booths
show and the ones you type correctly, in teleporter-codes.txt in the
same folder, and guidance level 1 lists them from the start of every
game after. To forget them, choose Forget the teleport codes in the
guidance menu, which shows while some are kept.


GUIDANCE
--------

Beside the game is a panel for optional help. Esc, or Select on a
gamepad, opens the guidance menu and pauses the game:

  Up and down          Choose a row.
  Left and right       Change the guidance level or training mode.
  Enter, or A          Step the level or a switch on; on Use these
                       settings, go back to the game with them; or
                       end this game, or exit, after pressing twice.
  Esc, or B or Select  Leave the menu without changing anything.

A and B are the pad's own letters, wherever its maker puts them: A is
the bottom button on an Xbox pad and the right one on a Switch pad. A
PlayStation pad uses the cross and the circle. The menu shows the
letters or marks of the pad that is connected.

Guidance has levels from 0, the original game, to 6; each adds to the
ones below it. Levels 1 to 3 show only what you could have written
down yourself; 4 and up tell you things you could not have known.
Turning it up, or training mode on, shows on that game's score, so
Use these settings asks first. Enter or A there uses them; Esc or B
goes back to the menu. So far:

  Level 1  Codes and the core: the codes of the teleports you have
           found in any game, entered or typed right, in a column at
           the panel's right, and under them
           each security door's three key code cards once its screen
           has shown them, numbered. A card stays dim until something
           you carry answers it: that card, a "?" card for one
           missing, or the access card for all three. The map shows
           each door's number where it stands. At the panel's top left
           are the core's nine slots in the game's own pictures: bright
           while still wanted, dim once delivered, outlined while you
           carry that piece.
  Level 2  The map you have walked: the rooms you have visited. Walls
           are lines, and a gap in one is a way on; the square is where
           you are and the diamonds are the teleports you have entered.
           A wall inside a room is drawn where it stands and divides
           it: the ways on either side of it do not meet. A dotted one
           is a security door or a space lock, which opens with the
           right item. A way on can still need a vacuum tube.
  Level 3  What you have seen: the items lying in the rooms you have
           walked through, each in the game's own picture and coloured
           by what it does: lilac for a key code card or the access
           card that opens any door, yellow for the key that opens
           space locks, white for something a trading pyramid takes,
           pink for a piece the core still needs. There are usually two
           of each piece; either will do, and while you carry one the
           other is not marked.
  Level 4  What you have not: the same in rooms you have not reached,
           outlined. The game places every item as a game starts, so
           it knows where they all are.
  Level 5  Routes: a line on the map and an arrow in the picture's
           border to a missing piece, in pink and marked "item", and
           while you carry a piece the core needs, one to the core, in
           orange and marked "core". Tab, or the pad's top button,
           switches the piece route between the three nearest pieces.
           The routes run over the whole map as the map reads it,
           dashed through rooms you have not visited, taking vacuum
           tubes up only, secret passages, and the teleports whose
           codes you have. The code a route needs next is outlined in
           its colour, and what its door still wants is ringed where
           it lies.
  Level 6  Everything: every teleport's and every door's code, whether
           you have been shown it or not, and the whole planet's map,
           the rooms you have never entered drawn dimmer.

Training mode is five switches under the level in the same menu, each
off or on: full energy, full bridging platforms and full laser each
fill their bar and keep it full; endless lives keeps a death from
costing one; no harm from enemies keeps them from draining energy or
killing, and stops the impalers and zap rays that kill on touch. The
score names the switches used, and a game played with any of them on
is not kept in the high-score table.
