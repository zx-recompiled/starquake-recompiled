//! A gamepad, read as the Kempston joystick.
//!
//! A Kempston interface is a joystick port: the game reads five bits and
//! cannot tell what moved them, so a gamepad drives them exactly as the
//! hardware would. The D-pad and the left stick move; up boards and flies the
//! hover platform, down flies it down, and neither builds. The bottom face
//! button is down but only builds, the right one up but only picks up
//! (#112), and the left one fires, as platformers lay them out (#88); the
//! top one does nothing in play. Pause is the odd one out — on a Spectrum
//! it is a key, not a joystick button — so Start presses the pause key.
//! Select opens the guidance picker (#1), where the D-pad works it, A does
//! an action wherever the pad's maker puts A, and B or Select closes it.
//!
//! How the pad is attached is not this code's business, or `gilrs`'s. A
//! Bluetooth controller the operating system has paired is an ordinary
//! gamepad by the time it reaches here, exactly as a USB one is; both arrive
//! through the same platform API. Hot-plugging is handled either way, since
//! `poll` drains the event queue before reading, which is where a pad that
//! has just connected turns up.

/// Which letters a pad's face buttons carry, from the maker it reports
/// itself as (#88). The buttons are read by position — `gilrs` names them
/// South, East, West and North whatever is printed on them — so this
